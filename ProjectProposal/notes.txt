sun rotates every 35 days at poles
earth every 24 hours -> 1 day
sun should rate 1/35 the speed of earth

earth circles sun every 365 days 
365/35 = 10.4 -> value to mod transformation by

ADDED FUNC: 'i' and 'd' increase/decrease speed of simulation
'f' freezes simulation

inital points for oregon eye position:  8.7, 0.6, 0.87

to try:
make camera fixed, rotate scene to sim earth viewpoint
			draw three different scenes, one for each viewpoint
			use same objects, just different transformations

earth to sun: 92.96 million miles
earth to moon: 238,900 mi
radius of earth: 3,959 mi
radius of moon: 1,079 mi
approx: 1/4 ratio

moon completes earth orbit in 27.322 days
moon completes lunar day in ~ 27.322 days
